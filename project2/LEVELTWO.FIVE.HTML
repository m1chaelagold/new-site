  There is a place where the sidewalk ends 
  
  and before the street begins, 
  
  and there the grass grows soft and 
  <STrong>white,</STrong>

  
  and there the sun burns crimson 
  <strong>bright,</strong>

  
  and there the moon-bird rests from his 
  <strong>flight</strong>

  
  to cool in the peppermint wind. 
  
  Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black 
  
  and the dark street winds and bends. 
  
  Past the pits where the asphalt flowers 
  <strong>grow</strong>

  
  we shall walk with a walk that is measured and 
  <strong>slow</strong>

  
  and watch where the chalk-white arrows 
  <strong>go</strong>
  to the place where the sidewalk ends. 
  
  Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and 
  <strong>slow,</strong>

  
  and we'll go where the chalk-white arrows 
  <strong>go,</strong>

  
  for the children, they mark, and the children, they 
  <strong>know,</strong>

  
  the place where the sidewalk ends.
