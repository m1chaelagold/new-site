<P>
   <H3>There is a place where the sidewalk ends </H3> 
    
    <H4>  and before the street begins, and there the grass grows soft and white, 
    </H4>
  <H5>
    and there the sun burns crimson bright, and there the moon-bird rests from his flight to cool in the peppermint wind. 
  </H5>
  <H6>
    Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black and the dark street winds and bends. 
  </H6>
  <BR>
  <H6>
    Past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow
  </H6>
<H5> we shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow and watch where the chalk-white arrows go to the place where the sidewalk ends.</H5>
<H4>
    Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and slow, 
</H4>
<H3>
    and we'll go where the chalk-white arrows go, for the children, 
</H3>
<H2>they mark, and the children, they know,

</H2>
  
  <H1>
    the place where the sidewalk ends. 
  </H1> 

</P>
