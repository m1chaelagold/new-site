        There is a place where the sidewalk ends and before the street begins, and there the grass grows soft and white, and there the sun burns crimson bright, and there the moon-bird rests from his flight to cool in the peppermint wind. 
        <br><br>
        
        Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black and the dark street winds and bends. Past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow   <br><br>  
      we shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow and watch where the chalk-white arrows go to the place where the sidewalk ends. 
      <br><br>
      Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and slow, and we'll go where the chalk-white arrows go, for the children, they mark, and the children, they know, the place where the sidewalk   <br><br>  <br><br>  <br><br>  <br><br>ends.
