        There is a place where the sidewalk ends and before the street begins, and there the grass   <br> <br>

        soft and white, and there the sun burns crimson bright, and there the moon-bird rests from his flight to cool in the peppermint wind. 
        <br><br>
        
        Let us leave this place where the smoke  <br>

      Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and  <br>s <br>l <br>o <br>w <br> <br> and we'll go where the chalk-white arrows  <br>g <br>o <br> <br> for the children, they mark, and the children, they  <br>k <br>n <br>o <br>w <br> the place where the sidewalk ends.
