  <h1>where the sidewalk ends 2. 3</h1>
</EM>
<h2>by shel silverstein</h2>
There is a place where the sidewalk ends 
<ul>
and before the street begins,
</ul>
<ul>  and there the grass grows soft and white,</ul>
<ul> and there the sun burns crimson bright, </ul>

<ul> and there the moon-bird rests from his flight to cool in the peppermint wind. </ul>


Let us leave this place where 
<ul> the smoke blows black and the dark street winds and bends.</ul>
<ul>

</ul>
<ul>Past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow</ul>
<ul>we shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow and watch where the chalk-white arrows go to the place where the sidewalk ends.  </ul>

Yes we'll 
<ul>walk with a walk that is measured and slow, </ul>
<ul> and we'll go where the chalk-white arrows go, </ul>
<ul>for the children, 

</ul>
<ul>they mark,</ul>
<ul> and the children, </ul>
<ul>they know,</ul>
<ul> the place where the sidewalk ends. </ul>
