    There is a place where the sidewalk ENDS <BR><BR></BR></BR>
    
    and before the street begins, and there the grass grows soft and WHITE,<BR><BR></BR></BR> 
    
    and there the sun burns crimson BRIGHT, <BR><BR></BR></BR>and there the moon-bird rests from his flight to cool in the peppermint WIND.<BR><BR></BR></BR>
     Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black and the dark street winds and BENDS. <BR><BR></BR></BR>Past the pits where the asphalt flowers GROW<BR><BR></BR></BR>
    we shall walk with a walk that is measured and SLOW <BR><BR></BR></BR>and watch where the chalk-white arrows GO <BR><BR></BR></BR>to the place where the sidewalk ENDS.<BR><BR></BR></BR> Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and SLOW, <BR><BR></BR></BR>and we'll go where the chalk-white arrows GO,<BR><BR></BR></BR> for the children, they MARK,<BR><BR></BR></BR> and the children, they KNOW,<BR><BR></BR></BR> <BR></BR>
    
    the place where the sidewalk ENDS. <BR><BR></BR></BR>
