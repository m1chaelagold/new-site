    <h1>where the sidewalk ends 1. 2</h1>
    <h2>by shel silverstein</h2>
    There is a place where the sidewalk ends 
    <br>
    <br>
    
    and before the street begins,
    <br> <br>
     and there the grass grows soft and white, 
     <br> <br>and there the sun burns crimson bright, 
     <br> <br>
     and there the moon-bird rests from his flight to cool in the peppermint wind.  <br> <br>
     Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black and the dark street winds and bends.  <br> <br>
     Past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow <br> <br>
    we shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow and watch where the chalk-white arrows go to the place where the sidewalk ends.  <br> <br>
    Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and slow, <br> <br>and we'll go where the chalk-white arrows go, <br> <br> for the children,  <br> <br>they mark, <br> <br> and the children,  <br> <br>they know,  <br> <br>the place where the sidewalk ends.
