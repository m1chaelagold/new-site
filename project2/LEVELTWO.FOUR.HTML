<span>  There </span>
<br>
is a place 
<br>

where the sidewalk 
<br>
ends and before the street 
<br>
begins, and there the grass grows 
<br>
soft and white, and there the sun burns 
<br>
crimson bright, and there the moon-bird rests 
<br>
from his flight to cool in the peppermint wind. Let 
<br>
us leave this place where the smoke blows black and 
<br>
the dark street winds and bends. Past the pits where the 
<br>
asphalt flowers grow
we shall walk with a walk that is measured 
<br>
and slow and watch where the chalk-white arrows go to the place where 
<br>
the sidewalk ends. Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and slow, and 
<br>
we'll go where the chalk-white arrows go, for the children, they mark, and the children, 
<br>
they know, the place where the sidewalk ends.
